# Versatify Product Requirements Document

## 1. Executive Summary
Versatify is a unified web service hosted at **versatify.me** that provides a suite of tools for file and image management. Users can convert files, upscale images and apply legally safe watermarks without switching between multiple apps. The solution is deployed on **Microsoft Azure Static Web Apps** with backend APIs running as Azure Functions. Processed files are stored temporarily on **Cloudflare R2**, not Azure Blob Storage.

## 2. Problem Statement
Existing image and file tools are fragmented. Users often download and upload files repeatedly across different services, leading to wasted time and poor experience. Access to advanced features like watermarking or upscaling is limited and legally risky. Versatify aims to solve this by providing all tools in one website.

## 3. Goals and Objectives
- **Primary Goal:** Provide all file and image tools from a single website, reducing friction for users.
- **Secondary Goals:**
  - Support multiple extensions and advanced image features.
  - Introduce AI-based assistance for improved workflows.
  - Offer legally compliant watermarking.
- **Success Metrics:**
  - Monthly active users.
  - Usage frequency per tool.
  - User satisfaction surveys.
  - Average processing time.

## 4. Target Audience
- **Primary Users:** Ages 10--30, digital natives needing quick file and image tasks.
- **Secondary Users:** Professionals in marketing, design, education, or small businesses requiring watermark protection.

## 5. User Stories
- As a student, I want to convert images for school assignments in a few clicks.
- As a creator, I want to upscale and zoom specific image regions for high-quality results.
- As an employee, I want to insert legal watermarks with company branding.
- As anyone, I want to generate a QR code to share information easily.
- As a user, I want AI to recommend the right tool automatically.

## 6. Functional Requirements
- **File Conversion** between formats such as JPG, PNG, PDF, DOC (up to 50MB per file).
- **Image Format Conversion** with quality preservation and processing within 5 seconds.
- **Image Upscaling** using AI to enhance resolution by 2--4x.
- **Selective Image Zoom** allowing users to pick a region for high-quality enlargement.
- **QR Code Generation** with custom designs, supporting static and dynamic codes.
- **Image Watermarking** with configurable opacity, position, and size that meets legal standards.

### Supporting Features
- AI-driven tool suggestions.
- Batch processing for multiple files.
- Result downloads and potential integration with external storage (e.g., Google Drive).
- Basic editing tools like crop and rotate.

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Average response time within 3 seconds.
- **Security:** SSL for file transfer and temporary storage, authentication for restricted features.
- **Usability:** Responsive interface for desktop and mobile.
- **Scalability:** Support 100k monthly concurrent users.
- **Compatibility:** Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## 8. Technical Considerations
- **Architecture:** Single Page Application front end (e.g., React or Vue) with Node.js Azure Functions.
- **Storage:** Files temporarily stored on Cloudflare R2. Auto deletion policy to clean up expired files.
- **Integration:** AI services for image processing and QR code libraries.
- **Data Handling:** Minimal user data, encrypted file transfers.

## 9. Success Metrics and KPIs
- Monthly active users above 10,000.
- Average session time above 5 minutes.
- Conversion success rate above 95%.
- Net Promoter Score above 60.

## 10. Timeline and Milestones
1. **Phase 1 (3 months):** MVP with file/image conversion, QR generation, basic watermarking.
2. **Phase 2 (2 months):** Add upscaling, selective zoom, and AI tool suggestions.
3. **Phase 3 (2 months):** Batch processing, advanced editing, and feature refinement.

## 11. Risks and Mitigation
- **Technical:** Large image processing might fail. Mitigate with cloud buffering and retries.
- **Legal:** Watermark disputes. Mitigate by continuous legal review.
- **Adoption:** Competing services may overshadow Versatify. Mitigate through AI automation and integrated user experience.

## 12. Future Considerations
- Video conversion and editing.
- More advanced AI editing and recommendations.
- Multi-language and global user support.
